1. Download your application and have it completed before you come to see us. The application and other helpful documents can be viewed and downloaded from the Building & Safety (https://www.fontana.org/136/Building-Safety) web pages.

3. Know what it is you want to build. (Is it a patio cover, gazebo, block wall, room addition, or? Is the structure new or is it replacing an existing structure? What size is it? How tall is it? Where on the property do you want to build it? What other structures exist on the property, and where are they located on the property?) 

4. Ask for help. Sometimes a project is just too big for you to handle on your own. Don't be afraid to seek help from a professional who has done this before. It can save you time, money, and a lot of headache in the long run. 

5. Make sure that you do your research. A check list entitled â€œBefore You Startâ€¦â€ will help you identify common concerns. (Checklist attached or web???) 

6. If available, bring pictures of your property in with you when you come to the counter. Pictures can help you explain your project and make sure that you receive accurate answers.

9. Visit the counter in the morning. Afternoon wait times tend to be longer.

Under this code, it is illegal to harbor or keep an animal that habitually barks, whines or makes loud noises in such a manner as to disturb the peace of the neighborhood.

While we try to educate the dog owner with possible solutions, it is unrealistic to think the problem can be rectified immediately. There are certainly some distractions that could be considered acceptable, such as cats, wildlife, trespassers, and playing. Even though there may be acceptable forms of barking, they will not necessarily be considered as an acceptable excuse for excessive or annoying barking. Please recognize that behavior modification is not an overnight occurrence, and that changing behavior will take time and patience.

We recommend that you speak with the dog owner about the problem and explain that the barking is disturbing. Many owners believe that if there are no complaints, then the neighbors are comfortable with the situation. Often, however, the owners are not home during the episodes and are completely unaware of the problem.

If barking continues, please call the non-emergency Police Department phone number (909)350-7700 and provide the following

â€¢ The exact address where the dog lives

â€¢ Your first and last name, as well as your mailing address.

Barking dog complaints will not be accepted anonymously.

You can also fill out a Service Request here (link)

After filing a complaint, the following will take place:

A notice will be mailed to the dog owner. The complainant's personal information is not provided to the dog owner at this point. The dog owner is given fourteen days to correct the habitual animal noise. On the fifteenth day of the dog owner being made aware of the noise complaint and if the noise complaint isn't modified to a reasonable level, you can contact Fontana Police Department Non-Emergency at (909) 350-7700 again. At this point the reporting party can request a Noise Complaint Document log. Noise Complaint Document log must be completed and returned to the Fontana Police Department with fifteen days. For the department to issue a citation on the complainant's behalf these forms are required.

The General Plan identifies and describes long range goals and objectives for the City of Fontana. Projects must comply with these goals and objectives in order to be approved. The City of Fontana General Plan is a very important document, as it represents the City's long-term vision. It guides all land use decisions in our community and is required by state law. From time to time, an applicant will propose a change in land use to the General Plan. These changes are called â€œGeneral Plan Amendments.â€ The General Plan was adopted only after extensive study and public hearings by the Planning Commission and the City Council. Any change in the General Plan must also go through the same process of study, review and public hearings. Some areas of the City develop under more focused regulatory guidance. Although consistent with the City's General Plan, these areas are regulated under adopted â€œSpecific Plans.â€ There are 27 Specific Plans located in the City of Fontana, of which, most are residential in character. Like the General Plan, specific plans are adopted only after extensive study and public hearings by the Planning Commission and the City Council. Changes proposed to a specific plan are requested through a â€œSpecific Plan Amendmentâ€ that also must go through the same process of study, review, and public hearings. Prior to filing for either a General Plan Amendment or Specific Plan Amendment, Fontana Municipal Code (FMC) Sections 30-33 and 30-68 requires a â€œPre-Applicationâ€ conference with City staff.

This request is called a variance (because the owner desires to â€œvaryâ€ from the rule(s) that usually apply). The City's Zoning and Development Code (FMC 30-202 and 30-213) defines how a variance can be used. Variances are not granted without serious deliberation. When deciding to grant a variance, decision-makers (either the Director of Planning, for a â€œMinor Variance,â€ or the Planning Commission) must make written findings explaining why a variance is, or is not, justified. These explanations must be backed up with facts that also become part of the written record of the decision. Financial hardship, community benefit, or the worthiness of the project is not a consideration. Also, a property owner cannot be granted a variance simply because they do not want to comply with a particular development standard. Additionally, a variance cannot be used to allow a land use that is not otherwise allowed in the zoning district that the property is located. Prior to filing for a Variance, Fontana Municipal Code (FMC) Section 30-204 and 30-215 requires a â€œPre-Applicationâ€ conference with City staff.

- Dividing an existing parcel into multiple parcels; or,
- Otherwise change the area and shape of a parcel by adjusting its lot lines.

There are several ways to subdivide a property depending upon the type of land use (residential, or commercial and industrial) and the total number of lots desired. Typically, for residential lots, subdividing four or less lots requires approval of a â€œTentative Parcel Mapâ€ application. Subdividing four or more lots requires approval of a â€œTentative Tract Mapâ€ application. The requirements for commercial and industrial zoned lots are slightly different, although the process is the same. Both maps require approval of the Planning Commission at a public hearing.

These applications are necessary to ensure that the public infrastructure (sidewalks, streets, intersections, public landscaping) is installed properly and can support the proposed development work.

FMC Chapter's 26 (Subdivisions) and 30 (Zoning and Development) govern the subdivision of property in the City of Fontana.
